// Temporary script to check what's happening with master data routes
// Let me search for the master data routes in the server

console.log("Checking server for master data routes...");

// Based on the error, it seems the issue is that the server is returning 500 errors
// The error message shows HTML from Cloudflare which indicates the server is crashing

// The issue is likely that the server is missing the master data routes or there's a syntax error

// Let me check what master data routes should exist based on the frontend code
